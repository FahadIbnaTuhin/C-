When you run your code, compiler make it to binary file and make .exe file. Clicking on .exe
file, will generate code in memory and it will be executed inside memory program area.

lots of programs are runnign on the os. We can quickly run out of memory.So the idea that is 
borned is called virtual memory. A trick that fools your program into thinking it is the only
program running on your os and all the momory resources belong to it. That's what our program 
thinks. The memory that the programs has that's called program map. All programs think, it belongs all the momory and it can do whatever it wants

Each program is abstracted into a process, and each process has access to the memory range
0 ~ (2^N - 1) where N is 32 on 32 bit systems and 64 on 64 bit systems.

Memory has to parts: 1) Real Memory(RAM) 2) Virtual Memory ( 0~(2^n-1) )
The entire program is not loaded in real memory by the CPU and MMU. Only parts that are about
to be executed are loaded. Making effective use of real memory, a valuable and lacking resource.

Virtual Memory: The memory map is a standard format defined by the OS. All programs written 
for that OS must confirm to it. It is usually divided into some sections.

A Memory map is divided into many parts. Some of them is : System, Stack, Heap, Data, Text
Stack and Heap is important here.
Stack: local variables, function calls | Heap: Additional memory that can be queried for at run time
